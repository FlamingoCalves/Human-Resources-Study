# Employee Satisfaction and Performance Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains an in-depth analysis focusing on factors influencing employee satisfaction and performance. The goal is to understand the key drivers behind these crucial metrics and how they interact with variables like salary, job role, and work environment.

## Dataset Description
The analysis utilizes a dataset from Kaggle encompassing various HR metrics such as salary, job satisfaction, performance ratings, department, and work history.

## Analysis Summary
- Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify initial correlations and data distribution.
- Developed predictive models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to analyze job satisfaction and performance ratings, facing challenges with class imbalance.
- Shifted focus to visualizations (boxplots, violin plots) due to model limitations, offering a qualitative understanding of factors affecting satisfaction and performance.

## Key Findings
- Salary does not strongly correlate with job satisfaction and performance ratings.
- Employee satisfaction and performance are influenced by a range of factors beyond monetary compensation.
- Visual analysis provided insights into the nuances of job satisfaction and performance dynamics.

## Future Work
- Expand the dataset for a more comprehensive analysis.
- Explore advanced modeling techniques and feature engineering.
